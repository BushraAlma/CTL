ABOUT THE OPENEXR_CTL LIBRARIES
----------------------------

IlmImfCtl provides a simplified OpenEXR interface to CTL

exrdpx is an initial version of a CTL-driven file converter
that translates DPX files into OpenEXR files and vice versa.
The conversion between the DPX and OpenEXR color spaces is
handled by CTL transforms.

exr_ctl_exr is an initial version of a program that can bake
the effect of a series of CTL transforms into the pixels of
an OpenEXR file.

WARNING: the exrdpx file converter and the exr_ctl_exr program are
still under development.  They are good enough for experimentation,
but they are not ready for production use.  The programs are slow,
and the DPX file I/O capabilities of exrdpx are minimal; most DPX
header fields and most OpenEXR attributes are lost during file
conversion.

The OpenEXR_CTL source code distribution is free software.  See the file
named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.


BUILDING OPENEXR_CTL
----------------

Building OpenEXR_CTL requires the OpenEXR and CTL libraries.

After installing the required libraries, to build OpenEXR_CTL on
GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do this:

./configure
make
make install

unless you obtained OpenEXR_CTL directly from CVS, in which case you
should first read README.CVS.

See README.OSX for details on building OpenEXR_CTL in MacOS X.

Do `make check` to run the OpenEXR_CTL confidence tests.  They should all
pass; if you find a test that does not pass on your system, please let
us know.

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting OpenEXR_CTL to a particular
platform.

All include files needed to use the OpenEXR_CTL libraries are installed in the 
OpenEXR subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/OpenEXR.


USING OPENEXR_CTL IN YOUR APPLICATIONS
----------------------------------

On systems with support for pkg-config, use `pkg-config --cflags
OpenEXR_CTL` for the C++ flags required to compile against OpenEXR
headers; and `pkg-config --libs OpenEXR_CTL` for the linker flags required
to link against OpenEXR_CTL libraries.

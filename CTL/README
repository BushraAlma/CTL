ABOUT THE CTL LIBRARIES
-----------------------

The CTL interpreter source code release contains the following
C++ libraries:

IlmCtl		The CTL interpreter front end and the interpreter's
		public programming interface.

IlmCtlSimd	The interpreter's SIMD back end.

IlmCtlMath	Math routines that are used by IlmCtlSimd: conversions
		between standard color spaces, 1D and 3D lookup tables,
		3D scattered data interpolation.

IlmCtlTest	Confidence tests for IlmCtl, IlmCtlSimd

IlmCtlMathTest	Confidence tests for IlmCtlMath

IlmCtlTest	Confidence tests for IlmImfCtl


LICENSE
-------

The CTL source code is distributed under the terms listed in
the named COPYING (included in this distribution).


BUILDING CTL
------------

Building CTL requires IlmBase.

After installing IlmBase, to build CTL on
GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do this:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Do `make check` to run the CTL confidence tests.  They should all
pass; if you find a test that does not pass on your system, please let
us know.

We have verified that CTL builds successfully on Linux.  Other UNIX
variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.  Let us know
if you're having problems porting CTL to a particular platform.

All include files needed to use the CTL libraries are installed in the 
CTL subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/CTL.


USING CTL IN YOUR APPLICATIONS
------------------------------

On systems with support for pkg-config, use `pkg-config --cflags
CTL` for the C++ flags required to compile against CTL headers;
and `pkg-config --libs CTL` for the linker flags required to link
against CTL libraries.
